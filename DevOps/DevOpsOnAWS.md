# DevOps on AWS

In general, Dev means developers and Ops means Operations (infrastructure Operations). Common myth, DevOps is Dev + Ops only. But actually it is a lot more than that.

**"DevOps is the Combination of cultural philophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at higher velocity." **
Ref. [https://aws.amazon.com/devops/](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/ "https://aws.amazon.com/devops/")

DevOps helps to achieve:
* Faster time to market.
* Higher quality.
* Lower cost to deliver.
