# DevOps

In general, Dev means developers and Ops means Operations (infrastructure Operations). Common myth, DevOps is Dev + Ops only. But actually it is a lot more than that.

"DevOps is the Combination of cultural philophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at higher velocity." <br><br>Ref. [https://aws.amazon.com/devops/](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/ "https://aws.amazon.com/devops/")
